# Talon documentation
For up-to-date documentation on Talon's API and features, please visit https://talon.wiki/. 

https://talon.wiki/unofficial_talon_docs/ is a great place to learn about Talon files, actions, and voice command definitions.

## Deruago talon voice command set

The voice set contains a subset of the Knausj set (found here: https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon).

I customised the knausj variant, so that it worked in my workplace. Meaning that some things are removed, and a lot are added.
